Despite rapid advances in autonomous AI scientists powered by language models, generating publicationready illustrations remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in the research workflow. To lift this burden, we
introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework for automated generation of publication-ready academic
illustrations. Powered by state-of-the-art VLMs and image generation models, PaperBanana orchestrates
specialized agents to retrieve references, plan content and style, render images, and iteratively refine
via self-critique. To rigorously evaluate our framework, we introduce PaperBananaBench, comprising
292 test cases for methodology diagrams curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, covering diverse
research domains and illustration styles. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana
consistently outperforms leading baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics.
We further show that our method effectively extends to the generation of high-quality statistical plots.
Collectively, PaperBanana paves the way for the automated generation of publication-ready illustrations.

Models (LLMs) (Anthropic, 2025; Comanici et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2024; OpenAI, 2025b; Yang et al.,
2025a), autonomous AI Scientists have demonstrated the potential to automate many facets of the
research lifecycle, such as literature review, idea generation, and experiment iteration (Gottweis et al.,
2025; Lu et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2025). Yet scientific discoveries achieve their full value only through
effective communication. Despite their proficiency in textual analysis and code execution, current
autonomous AI scientists struggle to visually communicate discoveries, especially for generating
illustrations (diagrams and plots) that adhere to the rigorous standards of academic manuscripts.
Among these illustration tasks, generating methodology diagrams represents a significant challenge, demanding both content fidelity and visual aesthetics. Prior endeavors for diagram generation
have predominantly adopted the code-based paradigm, leveraging TikZ (Belouadi and Eger, 2024;
Belouadi et al., 2025), Python-PPTX (Zheng et al., 2025), or SVG to programmatically synthesize
diagrams. While effective for structured content, these methods can encounter expressiveness limitations when attempting to produce the intricate visual elements – such as specialized icons and custom
shapes – that are increasingly common in modern AI publications. Conversely, although recent image
generation models (Deepmind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025a; Team et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025a) have
demonstrated advanced instruction-following capabilities and high-quality visual outputs, consistently
generating academic illustrations that meet scholarly standards remains a difficult task (Zuo et al.,
2025). Specialized expertise required for professional illustration tools often constrains researchers’
ability to freely express complex ideas, forcing them to invest substantial manual effort into crafting figures. This creates a significant bottleneck in the effective visual communication of scientific
discoveries.
In this paper, we introduce PaperBanana, an agentic framework designed to bridge this gap by
automating the production of high-quality academic illustrations. Given a methodology description
and diagram caption as input, PaperBanana orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-ofthe-art VLMs and image generation models (e.g. Gemini-3-Pro and Nano-Banana-Pro) to retrieve
reference examples, devise detailed plans for content and style, render images, and iteratively refine
via self-critique. This reference-driven collaborative workflow allows the system to effectively master
the logical composition and stylistic norms required for publication-ready illustrations. Beyond
methodology diagrams, our framework demonstrates significant versatility by extending to statistical
plots, offering a comprehensive solution for scientific visualization.
To rigorously evaluate our framework and address the absence of dedicated benchmarks for
automated academic illustration, we introduce PaperBananaBench, a comprehensive benchmark
for methodology diagram generation. The benchmark comprises 292 test cases and 292 reference
cases curated from NeurIPS 2025 publications, spanning diverse research topics and illustration
styles. To assess generation quality, we employ a VLM-as-a-Judge approach for reference-based
scoring against human illustrations across four dimensions: faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and
aesthetics, with reliability verified through correlation with human judgments.
Comprehensive experiments on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperBanana.
Our method consistently outperforms leading baselines across all four evaluation dimensions—
faithfulness (+2.8%), conciseness (+37.2%), readability (+12.9%), and aesthetics (+6.6%)—as well
as the aggregated overall score (+17.0%) for diagram generation. We further show that our method
also seamlessly extends to statistical plots. Collectively, our method paves the way for automating
the generation of academic illustrations (Examples shown in Figure 1). As a demonstration of its
capability, figures marked with in this manuscript were entirely generated using PaperBanana.
Additionally, we discuss intriguing settings including using our framework to enhance existing humancreated illustrations and using image generation models for statistical plot generation. To sum up,
our contributions are:

2

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

• We propose PaperBanana, a fully automated agentic framework that orchestrates specialized
agents to generate publication-ready academic illustrations.
• We construct PaperBananaBench to assess the quality of academic illustrations, particularly
methodology diagrams.
• Comprehensive experiments show that our workflow significantly outperforms leading baselines,
showing promise for automating the generation of academic illustrations.

2. Task Formulation
We formalize the task of automated academic illustration generation as learning a mapping from a
source context and a communicative intent to a visual representation. Let 𝑆 denote the source context
containing the essential information, and 𝐶 denote the communicative intent that specifies the scope
and focus of the desired illustration. The goal is to generate an image 𝐼 that faithfully visualizes 𝑆
while fulfilling the communicative intent 𝐶 , formulated as:
𝐼 = 𝑓 ( 𝑆, 𝐶 ) .

(1)

To further guide the mapping function, the input can be optionally augmented by a set of 𝑁 reference
examples E = { 𝐸𝑛 } 𝑛𝑁=1 . Each example 𝐸𝑛 serves as a ground-truth demonstration, defined as a
tuple 𝐸𝑛 = (𝑆𝑛 , 𝐶𝑛 , 𝐼𝑛 ), where 𝐼𝑛 is the reference illustration corresponding to the context 𝑆𝑛 and
communicative intent 𝐶𝑛 . Integrating this, the unified task formulation becomes:
𝐼 = 𝑓 ( 𝑆, 𝐶, E) ,

(2)

where E defaults to ∅ when no examples are used (i.e., zero-shot generation).
Among various types of academic illustrations, this paper primarily focuses on the automated
generation of methodology diagrams, which requires interpreting complex technical concepts and
logical flows from textual descriptions into high-fidelity, visually pleasing illustrations. In this setting,
the source context 𝑆 is the textual description of the method (e.g., methodology sections), and the
communicative intent 𝐶 is the figure caption specifying the scope and focus (e.g., “Overview of our
framework”).

3. Methodology
In this section, we present the architecture of PaperBanana, a reference-driven agentic framework for
automated academic illustration. As illustrated in Figure 2, PaperBanana orchestrates a collaborative
team of five specialized agents—Retriever, Planner, Stylist, Visualizer, and Critic—to transform raw
scientific content into publication-quality diagrams and plots. (See Appendix G for prompts)
Retriever Agent. Given the source context 𝑆 and the communicative intent 𝐶 , the Retriever Agent
identifies 𝑁 most relevant examples E = { 𝐸𝑛 } 𝑛𝑁=1 ⊂ R from the fixed reference set R to guide the
downstream agents. As defined in Section 2, each example 𝐸 𝑖 ∈ R is a triplet ( 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝐼 𝑖 ). To leverage
the reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt a generative retrieval approach where the VLM performs
selection over candidate metadata:

E = VLMRet 𝑆, 𝐶, {( 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 )} 𝐸𝑖 ∈ R
(3)
Specifically, the VLM is instructed to rank candidates by matching both research domain (e.g., Agent
& Reasoning) and diagram type (e.g., pipeline, architecture), with visual structure being prioritized
over topic similarity. By explicitly reasoned selection of reference illustrations 𝐼 𝑖 whose corresponding
3

Overview of our PaperBanana framework. Given the source context and communicative intent, we
first apply a Linear Planning Phase to retrieve relevant reference examples and synthesize a stylistically
optimized description. We then use an Iterative Refinement Loop (consisting of Visualizer and Critic
Agents) to transform the description into visual output and conduct multi-round refinements to
produce the final academic illustration.
contexts ( 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 ) best match the current requirements, the Retriever provides a concrete foundation
for both structural logic and visual style.
Planner Agent. The Planner Agent serves as the cognitive core of the system. It takes the source
context 𝑆, communicative intent 𝐶 , and retrieved examples E as inputs. By performing in-context
learning from the demonstrations in E, the Planner translates the unstructured or structured data in
𝑆 into a comprehensive and detailed textual description 𝑃 of the target illustration:
𝑃 = VLMplan ( 𝑆, 𝐶, {( 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐶 𝑖 , 𝐼 𝑖 )} 𝐸𝑖 ∈ E ) .

(4)

Stylist Agent. To ensure the output adheres to the aesthetic standards of modern academic
manuscripts, the Stylist Agent acts as a design consultant. A primary challenge lies in defining
a comprehensive “academic style,” as manual definitions are often incomplete. To address this, the
Stylist traverses the entire reference collection R to automatically synthesize an Aesthetic Guideline
G covering key dimensions such as color palette, shapes and containers, lines and arrows, layout
and composition, and typography and icons (see Appendix F for the summarized guideline and
implementation details). Armed with this guideline, the Stylist refines each initial description 𝑃 into
a stylistically optimized version 𝑃 ∗ :
𝑃 ∗ = VLMstyle ( 𝑃, G) .
(5)
This ensures that the final illustration is not only accurate but also visually professional.
Visualizer Agent. After receiving the stylistically optimized description 𝑃 ∗ , the Visualizer Agent
collaborates with the Critic Agent to render academic illustrations and iteratively refine their quality.
The Visualizer Agent leverages an image generation model to transform textual descriptions into
visual output. In each iteration 𝑡 , given a description 𝑃𝑡 , the Visualizer generates:
𝐼𝑡 = Image-Gen( 𝑃𝑡 ) ,

(6)

where the initial description 𝑃0 is set to 𝑃 ∗ .
4

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

Critic Agent. The Critic Agent forms a closed-loop refinement mechanism with the Visualizer by
closely examining the generated image 𝐼𝑡 and providing refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 to the Visualizer.
Upon receiving the generated image 𝐼𝑡 at iteration 𝑡 , the Critic inspects it against the original source
context ( 𝑆, 𝐶 ) to identify factual misalignments, visual glitches, or areas for improvement. It then
provides targeted feedback and produces a refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 that addresses the identified
issues:
𝑃𝑡+1 = VLMcritic ( 𝐼𝑡 , 𝑆, 𝐶, 𝑃𝑡 ) .
(7)
This revised description is then fed back to the Visualizer for regeneration. The Visualizer-Critic loop
iterates for 𝑇 = 3 rounds, with the final output being 𝐼 = 𝐼𝑇 . This iterative refinement process ensures
that the final illustration meets the high standards required for academic dissemination.
Extension to Statistical Plots. The framework extends to statistical plots by adjusting the Visualizer
and Critic agents. For numerical precision, the Visualizer converts the description 𝑃𝑡 into executable
Python Matplotlib code: 𝐼𝑡 = VLMcode ( 𝑃𝑡 ). The Critic evaluates the rendered plot and generates a
refined description 𝑃𝑡+1 addressing inaccuracies or imperfections: 𝑃𝑡+1 = VLMcritic ( 𝐼𝑡 , 𝑆, 𝐶, 𝑃𝑡 ). The
same 𝑇 = 3 round iterative refinement process applies. While we prioritize this code-based approach
for accuracy, we also explore direct image generation in Section 6. See Appendix G.2 for adjusted
prompts.

4. Benchmark Construction
The lack of benchmarks hinders rigorous evaluation of automated diagram generation. We address
this with PaperBananaBench, a dedicated benchmark curated from NeurIPS 2025 methodology
diagrams, capturing the sophisticated aesthetics and diverse logical compositions of modern AI papers.
We detail the construction pipeline and evaluation protocol below; dataset statistics are in Figure 3.
4.1. Data Curation
Collection & Parsing. We begin by randomly sampling 2,000 papers from the 5,275 publications
at NeurIPS 2025 and retrieving their PDF files. Subsequently, we utilize the MinerU toolkit (Niu
et al., 2025) to parse these documents, extracting the text of the methodology sections, and all the
diagrams and their captions in the paper.
Filtering. We then apply a filtering stage to
ensure data quality. First, we discard papers
without methodology diagrams, yielding 1,359
valid candidates. Second, we restrict the aspect
ratio (𝑤 : ℎ) to [1.5, 2.5]. Ratios below 1.5 are
excluded as methodology diagrams typically require wider landscape layouts for logical flows,
while ratios exceeding 2.5 are unsupported by
current image generation models. Including
such outliers would introduce bias in side-byside evaluations by revealing the human origin
of candidates. This yields 610 valid candidates,
each a tuple ( 𝑆, 𝐼, 𝐶 ), where 𝑆 is the methodology description, 𝐼 is the methodology diagram,
and 𝐶 is the caption.

Figure 3 | [Generated by ] Statistics of the test set
of PaperBananaBench (totaling 292 samples).
The average length of source context / figure caption is 3,020.1 / 70.4 words.

Categorization. To facilitate future analysis of generating different types of diagrams, we further
5

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

categorize the diagrams into four classes, based on visual topology and content: Agent & Reasoning,
Vision & Perception, Generative & Learning, and Science & Applications (see Appendix C for definitions).
Gemini-3-Pro is used to perform the categorization, assigning samples with hybrid elements to their
predominant category.
Human Curation. Finally, we conduct a human curation phase to guarantee the integrity and quality
of the dataset. Annotators are tasked with verifying and correcting the extracted methodology
descriptions and captions, validating the correctness of diagram categorizations, and filtering out
diagrams of insufficient visual quality (e.g., overly simplistic, cluttered, or abstract designs). Following
this rigorous process, 584 valid samples remain. We randomly partition these into two equal subsets:
a test set ( 𝑁 = 292) for evaluation and a reference set ( 𝑁 = 292) to facilitate retrieval-augmented
in-context learning.
4.2. Evaluation Protocol
We utilize VLM-as-a-Judge to assess the quality of methodology diagrams and statistical plots. Given
the inherent subjectivity in evaluating visual design, we employ a referenced comparison approach
where the judge compares the model-generated diagram against the human-drawn diagram to
determine which better satisfies each evaluation criterion.
Evaluation Dimensions. Inspired by Quispel et al. (2018), we evaluate diagrams on two perspectives.
Detailed rubrics for each dimension are provided in Appendix H.
• Content (Faithfulness & Conciseness): Faithfulness ensures alignment with the source context
(methodology description) and communicative intent (caption), while Conciseness requires focusing
on core information without visual clutter.
• Presentation (Readability & Aesthetics): Readability demands intelligible layouts, legible text,
no excessive crossing lines, etc. Aesthetics evaluates adherence to the stylistic norms of academic
manuscripts.
Referenced Scoring. For each dimension, the VLM judge compares the model-generated diagram
against the human reference given the context and caption. It determines Model wins, Human wins,
or Tie based on relative quality, which are then mapped to scores of 100, 0, and 50, respectively. To
aggregate scores into an overall metric, we follow the design principle that information visualization
must primarily “show the truth” (Mackinlay, 1986; Quispel et al., 2018; Tufte and Graves-Morris,
1983). We employ a hierarchical aggregation strategy, designating faithfulness and readability as
primary dimensions, and conciseness and aesthetics as secondary. If primary dimensions yield a
decisive winner (i.e., winning both, or winning one with a tie), this determines the overall winner. In
case of a tie (e.g., each wins one, or both tie), we apply the same rule to the secondary dimensions.
This hierarchical approach ensures that content fidelity and clarity take precedence over aesthetics
and conciseness.

5. Experiments
5.1. Baseline Methods and Models
We compare PaperBanana against three baseline settings: (1) Vanilla, directly prompting the image
generation model to generate diagrams based on the input context (methodology description and
caption); (2) Few-shot, building upon the vanilla baseline by augmenting the prompt with 10 few-shot
examples, where each example consists of a triplet (methodology description, caption, diagram) to
enable in-context learning for the image generation model; (3) Paper2Any (Liu et al., 2025), an agentic

our setting. For VLM backbone, we default to Gemini-3-Pro, while for image generation model, we
experiment with Nano-Banana-Pro and GPT-Image-1.5. (See Appendix C for more implementation
details.)
5.2. Evaluation Settings.
Evaluating the quality of generated diagrams demands strong visual perception and understanding
capabilities, particularly for the Faithfulness dimension, which requires accurately identifying and
interpreting subtle modules and connections. Hence, we employ Gemini-3-Pro as our VLM-based
Judge. To validate its reliability, we randomly sampled 50 cases (25 from vanilla and 25 from our
method) and conducted a two-fold validation process:
Inter-Model Agreement (Consistency). First, we verify that our evaluation protocol is robust and
model-agnostic. We evaluated the agreement between our judge (Gemini-3-Pro) and other distinct
VLMs (Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5). Kendall’s tau correlations with Gemini-3-Flash across the four
dimensions (Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, Aesthetic) and their aggregation are 0.51, 0.60,
0.45, 0.56, and 0.55, respectively; correlations with GPT-5 are 0.43, 0.47, 0.44, 0.42, and 0.45,
respectively. This confirms the consistency of our protocol across different judge models1 .
Human Alignment (Validity). Second, we verify that our VLM judge is a valid proxy for human
evaluation. We tasked two human annotators to independently perform reference-based scoring
on the same 50 samples using the same rubrics, followed by a discussion to reach consensus on
conflicting cases. Kendall’s tau correlations between Gemini-3-Pro and human annotations are 0.43,
0.57, 0.45, 0.41, and 0.45, respectively. These strong correlations demonstrate that our VLM-based
judge aligns well with human perception. (See Appendix B for more details.)
5.3. Main Results
Table 1 summarizes the performance of ours and baseline methods on PaperBananaBench. PaperBanana consistently outperforms leading baselines across all metrics. We attribute the poor
performance of GPT-Image in both vanilla and agentic settings to its weaker instruction following and
text rendering capabilities compared to Nano-Banana-Pro, which fails to meet the strict requirements

generally considered to represent relatively strong agreement

of academic illustration. Similarly, while Paper2Any also supports generating paper figures, it prioritizes the presentation of high-level ideas rather than the faithful depiction of specific methodological
flows necessary for methodology diagrams. This objective mismatch leads to its underperformance in
our evaluation setting.
In contrast, PaperBanana achieves comprehensive improvements over the Vanilla Nano-BananaPro baseline: Faithfulness (+2.8%), Conciseness (+37.2%), Readability (+12.9%), and Aesthetics
(+6.6%), contributing to a +17.0% gain in the Overall score. Regarding performance across categories,
Agent & Reasoning achieves the highest overall score (69.9%), followed by Scientific & Application
(58.8%) and Generative & Learning (57.0%), while Vision & Perception scores the lowest (52.1%).
We also conducted a blind human evaluation on a subset of 50 cases to compare PaperBanana
against vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro (See Appendix B for details). The average win / tie / loss rate of
PaperBanana from 3 human judges is 72.7% / 20.7% / 6.6%, respectively. This further validates that
our agentic workflow shows promising improvements in automated methodology diagram generation.
(See Appendix Figure 7 for case studies)
Despite the progress, we note that PaperBanana still underperforms the human reference in
terms of faithfulness. We have included some failure analysis in Appendix Figure 10 to provide
insights into the challenges.
5.4. Ablation Study
To understand the contribution of each agent component, we conduct an ablation study, with results
presented in Table 2.
Impact of the Retriever Agent. We compare the semantic retriever with random and no-retriever
baselines (rows ④–⑥ in Table 2). Without reference examples as guidance, the no-retriever setting
significantly underperforms in Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics, as the Planner defaults
to verbose, exhaustive descriptions. Moreover, lacking exposure to academic diagram aesthetics,
this setting produces visually less refined outputs. Interestingly, the random retriever achieves
performance comparable to the semantic approach, suggesting that providing general structural and
stylistic patterns is more critical than precise content matching.
Impact of the Stylist and Critic Agents. Comparing rows ③ and ④ shows that the Stylist boosts
Conciseness (+17.5%) and Aesthetics (+4.7%) but lowers Faithfulness (-8.5%), as visual polishing
sometimes omits technical details. However, the Critic Agent (row ① vs. ③) effectively bridges this

gap, substantially recovering Faithfulness. Additional iterations further enhance all metrics, ensuring
a balance between aesthetics and technical accuracy.
5.5. PaperBanana for Statistical Plots Generation.
PaperBanana operates by first synthesizing a detailed description of the target illustration, then
visualizing it into an image. Unlike methodology diagrams that prioritize aesthetics and logical
coherence, statistical plots demand rigorous numerical precision, making standard image generation
models unsuitable. To address this, we demonstrate that by adopting executable code for visualization,
PaperBanana seamlessly extends to statistical plot generation.
Testset Curation. Following the task formulation in Section 2, we assess PaperBanana’s capability
to generate statistical plots from tabular data and brief visual descriptions. Since raw data of statistical
plots is rarely available in academic manuscripts, we repurpose ChartMimic (Yang et al., 2025b), a
dataset originally constructed for chart-to-code generation. This dataset primarily includes statistical
plots from arXiv papers and Matplotlib galleries, paired with human-curated Python code. Leveraging
Gemini-3-Pro, we extract the underlying tabular data from the code and synthesize a brief description
for each plot. Following rigorous filtering and sampling (see Appendix D), we curate 240 test cases
and 240 reference examples, stratified across seven plot categories—bar chart, line chart, tree &
pie chart, scatter plot, heatmap, radar chart, and miscellaneous—and two complexity levels (easy
and hard). For evaluation, we adhere to the protocol detailed in Section 4, with prompts specifically
tailored to statistical plots.
Figure 4 compares PaperBanana with vanilla Gemini-3-Pro on our curated test set. Our method
consistently outperforms the baseline across all dimensions, achieving gains of +1.4%, +5.0%,
+3.1%, and +4.0% in Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics, respectively, resulting
in a +4.1% overall improvement. Notably, PaperBanana slightly surpasses human performance in
Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics while remaining competitive in Faithfulness, showcasing its
effectiveness for statistical plot.

6. Discussion
6.1. Enhancing Aesthetics of Human-Drawn Diagrams
Given the summarized aesthetic guidelines G, an intriguing question arises: can these guidelines serve
to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-drawn diagrams? To explore this, we implement a
streamlined pipeline where Gemini-3-Pro first formulates up to 10 actionable suggestions based on
9

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

the original diagram and G, which are then
executed by Nano-Banana-Pro to refine the image. We evaluate the results using our referencebased protocol, comparing the refined output
against the original human-drawn diagram.
Across the 292 test cases, the refined diagrams
achieved a win / tie / loss ratio of 56.2% / 6.8%
/ 37.0% in aesthetics against their original counterparts, showing that the summarized aesthetic
guidelines can indeed serve to elevate the aesthetic quality of existing human-authored diagrams. An illustrative example is provided in
Figure 6. More examples are provided in AppendixFigure 8.

Figure 6 | Example of enhancing aesthetics of
human-drawn diagrams.

6.2. Coding vs Image Generation for Visualizing Statistical Plots
For statistical plots, code-based approaches have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, as evidenced
by Figure 4 and prior studies (Chen et al., 2025; Goswami et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024). Given
the advanced fidelity and visual appeal of recent image generation models, we compare code-based
(Gemini-3-Pro) and image-generation-based (Nano-Banana-Pro) approaches for the Visualizer agent
in PaperBanana, as shown in Figure 5. Results reveal distinct trade-offs: image generation excels
in presentation (Readability and Aesthetics) but underperforms in content fidelity (Faithfulness
and Conciseness). Manual inspection shows that while image models faithfully render sparse plots,
they struggle with dense or complex data, exhibiting numerical hallucinations or element repetition
(Appendix Figure 9). Thus, hybridly using image generation for sparse visualizations and code for
dense plots may offer the best balance.

7. Related Work
7.1. Automated Academic Diagram Generation.
Automated academic diagram generation remains a long-standing challenge (Rodriguez et al., 2023).
Prior work primarily adopts code-based generation using TikZ (Belouadi and Eger, 2024; Belouadi
et al., 2025; Hsu and Eger, 2023; Zhang et al., 2025) or Python-PPT (Pang et al., 2025; Zheng
et al., 2025) for programmatic synthesis. While effective for structured content, these approaches
face expressiveness limitations in generating the intricate visual designs prevalent in modern AI
publications.
Recent image generation models have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-fidelity,
visually sophisticated figures (Deepmind, 2025; OpenAI, 2025a; Tang et al., 2026; Team et al., 2025;
Zuo et al., 2025), offering a promising alternative. Concurrent to our work, AutoFigure (Anonymous,
2026) 2 transforms scientific content into symbolic representations before rendering them as images
using GPT-Image. In comparison, our method achieves broader generalizability through adaptive
retrieval and academic-style transfer, with greater extensibility by supporting both methodology
diagrams and statistical plots in a unified pipeline.
For evaluation benchmarks, quality assessment of auto-generated diagrams remains less explored.
Most closely related to PaperBananaBench is SridBench (Chang et al., 2025), which evaluates

automated diagram generation from method sections and captions across computer science and
natural science domains. We will report results once it is publicly available.
7.2. Coding-Based Data Visualization
While the inherent complexity of academic diagram generation has deterred pioneering research,
visualizing statistical data has garnered extensive attention since the rise of language models. Early
endeavors (Dibia and Demiralp, 2019) employed LSTM-based models to convert JSON data into
Vega-Lite visualizations, followed by few-shot and zero-shot coding approaches (Dibia, 2023; Galimzyanov et al., 2025; Li et al., 2024; Tian et al., 2024) leveraging large-scale backbones such as
ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022). More recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated remarkable progress
in coding-based data visualization (Chen et al., 2025; Goswami et al., 2025; Seo et al., 2025; Yang
et al., 2024), leveraging fundamental mechanisms such as test-time scaling (Snell et al., 2024)
and self-reflection (Shinn et al., 2023). While this paper is more focused on automated generation
of academic diagrams and plots, these agentic frameworks can be seamlessly integrated into our
Visualizer Agent to enhance its capability in translating detailed descriptions of desired plots into
robust Python code. Complementary to generation, recent efforts have also explored reversing plots
back into their original code (Wu et al., 2025b; Yang et al., 2025b), challenging both the perception
and coding capabilities of VLMs.

8. Conclusion
This paper introduces PaperBanana, an agentic framework designed to automate the generation
of publication-ready academic illustrations. By orchestrating specialized agents—Retriever, Planner, Stylist, Visualizer, and Critic—our approach transforms scientific content into high-fidelity
methodology diagrams and statistical plots. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we presented PaperBananaBench, a comprehensive benchmark curated from top-tier AI conferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PaperBanana significantly outperforms existing baselines in faithfulness, conciseness, readability, and aesthetics, paving the way for AI scientists to autonomously
communicate their discoveries with professional-grade visualizations.

9. Limitations and Future Directions
As a pioneering work, although PaperBanana achieves promising results, it inevitably faces certain
limitations. This section will discuss these limitations in detail, and outline the corresponding future
directions we envision.
Towards Editable Academic Illustrations. The most prominent limitation of PaperBanana lies in
the raster nature of its output. Unlike vector graphics—which are preferred in academic contexts
for their infinite scalability and precise detail preservation—raster images are inherently difficult to
edit. While generating outputs at 4K resolution serves as a viable workaround to ensure high visual
fidelity, it does not fundamentally resolve the challenge of post-generation modification. To address
this, we envision three potential solutions catering to varying levels of editing needs. For minor visual
adjustments, leveraging state-of-the-art image editing models, such as Nano-Banana-Pro, serves as the
most direct approach. For more structural modifications, a reconstruction pipeline as exemplified by
Paper2Any (Liu et al., 2025) and Edit Banana (BIT-DataLab, 2025) can be adopted: employing OCR
for text extraction and SAM3 for pattern segmentation, followed by reassembling these elements on
presentation slides (e.g., via Python-PPTX). While currently facing challenges when handling complex
backgrounds and intricate visual elements, we anticipate that training specialized element extraction
11

models will significantly enhance the robustness of this reconstruction. Finally, a more advanced
direction involves developing a GUI Agent capable of autonomously operating professional vector
design software (Huang et al., 2026; Sun et al., 2025), such as Adobe Illustrator. This would enable
the direct generation of fully editable vector graphics, although it necessitates the agent to possess
exceptional perception, planning and interaction capabilities.
The Trade-off between Style Standardization and Diversity. The second limitation lies in the
trade-off between style standardization and diversity. While our unified style guide ensures rigid
compliance with academic standards, it inevitably reduces the stylistic diversity of the output. Future
work could explore more dynamic style adaptation mechanisms that allow for a broader range of
artistic expressions and personalized aesthetic choices while maintaining professional rigor.
The Challenge of Fine-Grained Faithfulness. While PaperBanana excels in aesthetics, a performance gap in faithfulness compared to human experts remains. As shown in our failure analysis
(Figure 10 in the Appendix), the most prevalent errors involve fine-grained connectivity, such as
misaligned start/end points or incorrect arrow directions. These subtleties often escape the detection
of current critic models, limiting the efficacy of self-correction. We posit that closing this gap primarily
hinges on advancing the fine-grained visual perception capabilities of the foundation VLMs.
Advancing Evaluation Paradigms. Following existing practices, our evaluation adopts a referencebased VLM-as-a-Judge setup. Despite its effectiveness, we acknowledge that this evaluation paradigm
still faces inherent challenges. First, regarding faithfulness, quantifying structural correctness remains
challenging, as detecting subtle errors in connectivity and notation requires high-precision scrutiny.
Future protocols could benefit from incorporating fine-grained, structure-based (Liang and You, 2025)
or rubric-based (Huang et al., 2026; Li et al., 2025) metrics, which may offer higher accuracy despite
their increased computational complexity. Second, for subjective dimensions such as aesthetics, we
observe that textual prompting is often insufficient to fully align the VLM with human preferences.
We envision that training customized reward models to bridge this alignment gap represents a crucial
direction for future research.
Test-Time Scaling for Diverse Preferences. Currently, our framework produces a single output
for each query. However, given the inherent stochasticity of generative models and the subjectivity
of aesthetic preferences, a single result may not universally satisfy diverse user tastes. A natural
extension is to implement test-time scaling by generating a spectrum of candidates with varying styles
and compositions. This paradigm shifts the focus from single-shot generation to a generate-and-select
workflow, enabling either human users or VLM-based preference models to select the illustration that
best aligns with their specific requirements.
Extension to Broader Domains. Beyond academic illustrations, our framework establishes a generalizable paradigm: leveraging retrieval to instruct the model on what to generate (target diagram
types) and employing automatic style summarization to teach it how to generate (stylistic norms). By
effectively decoupling structural planning from aesthetic rendering, this reference-driven approach
bypasses the need for expensive domain-specific fine-tuning. We believe this paradigm holds significant promise for other specialized domains requiring strict adherence to community standards, such
as UI/UX design, patent drafting, and industrial schematics.

Impact Statement
This paper introduces PaperBanana, a framework designed to automate the generation of academic
illustrations. Our goal is to democratize access to high-quality visual communication tools, particularly
benefiting researchers who may lack professional design resources. By reducing the manual effort
required for diagram creation, we aim to accelerate the scientific workflow. However, we acknowledge
the ethical risk associated with generative models, specifically the potential for “visual hallucination”
or unfaithful representation of technical details. It is imperative that users of such systems reject
blind reliance and maintain rigorous human oversight to ensure the scientific integrity of published
illustrations.

A. Dedicated Case Studies
Cases Demonstrating the Effectiveness of PaperBanana We provide 2 cases in Figure 7 to
demonstrate the capability of PaperBanana for aiding the generation of academic illustrations.
Given the same source context and caption, the vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro often produces diagrams
with outdated color tones and overly verbose content. In contrast, our PaperBanana generates
results that are more concise and aesthetically pleasing, while maintaining faithfulness to the source
context.

Analysis

In general, while being faithful to the source context, PaperBanana demonstrates clear advantages over vanilla
Nano-Banana-Pro across multiple dimensions.
1. From an aesthetic perspective, Case 1 and Case 2 both show that PaperBanana employs more modern and
harmonious color palettes (e.g., soft blue and orange zones) compared to the outdated grey tones in Nano-Banana-Pro.
2. Regarding conciseness, PaperBanana effectively distills core information while eliminating redundant textual
descriptions, making the diagrams cleaner and more focused.
3. In terms of logical clarity, PaperBanana utilizes distinct colored blocks and zones to separate different functional
modules (e.g., ``Lens Module'' and ``Reasoning Module'' in Case 1; ``Confidence Estimation (ECE)'' and ``Volume \&
Disparity'' in Case 2), thereby enhancing the readability and comprehensibility of complex methodological workflows.

contrast, our PaperBanana generates results that are more concise and aesthetically pleasing, while
maintaining faithfulness to the source context.

Enhancing the Aesthetics of Human-Drawn Diagrams We provide additional cases in Figure 8 to
demonstrate the interesting scenario of enhancing the aesthetics of human-drawn diagrams with our
auto-summarized style guidelines. It is observed that the polished diagrams demonstrate significant
stylistic improvements in color schemes, typography, graphical elements, etc.

Failure Cases of PaperBanana. Figure 10 shows 3 failure cases of PaperBanana. We observe that
the primary failure mode involves connection errors, such as redundant connections and mismatched
source-target nodes. Our preliminary analysis reveals that the critic model often fails to identify
these connectivity issues, suggesting these errors may originate from the foundation model’s inherent
perception limitations. Resolving this challenge likely necessitates advancements in the underlying
foundation model.
Diagrams from PaperBanana

Failure Reasons
The attention block incorrectly draws
connections from the Noise Predictor (
𝑓𝑠𝑑) to three destination boxes,
𝑖

labeling two of them as 'Keys (𝐾 )'
𝑖

and one as 'Values (𝑉 )'. The text (Eq.
2) explicitly states that diffusion
features map only to Keys and Values,
𝑖

while Queries (𝑄 ) come from
learnable parameters.

It fails to draw generative connections
(solid lines) from Actions (𝑎) to
Task-Relevant States (𝑠). The method
explicitly states (Eq. 3) that state
transitions depend on previous actions
(ℎ'𝑡 = 𝑓(..., 𝑎𝑡−1)). By isolating the
actions without driving the state
dynamics, the diagram fails to
represent the fundamental structure of
a control/world model described in the
text.
The text explicitly states, "We note
that the Decoder and Predictor can
only access information of t through
e" and defines the Decoder's input as
the embedding and the goal (
D(e,g))). However, the Model diagram
draws a dotted skip connection from
the "Tactic t" block directly to the
Decoder, replacing the required
"Goal" connection. This violates the
functional constraints described in the
methodology.

such as redundant connections and mismatched source-target nodes. Our preliminary analysis reveals
that the critic model often fails to identify these connectivity issues, suggesting these errors may
originate from the foundation model’s inherent perception limitations. Resolving this challenge likely
necessitates advancements in the underlying foundation model.

B. Human Evaluation Setup
To ensure the reliability of our automated metrics and strict benchmarking of our method, this
paper conducted two distinct human evaluation experiments. Both evaluations employed the same
four dimensions defined in Section 4 (Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics) and
adhered to the same detailed rubrics used by our VLM judge. We utilized Streamlit to build dedicated
annotation interfaces for these tasks.
Validation of VLM-as-a-Judge. The objective of this human evaluation is to assess the alignment
between our VLM-based judge (Gemini-3-Pro) and human judgment. We randomly sampled 50
cases (25 from the Vanilla baseline and 25 from PaperBanana) from the test set. For each case,
two experienced researchers were presented with the Method Section, Caption, the human-drawn
reference diagram, and a model-generated candidate (either from our method or the baseline). They
were tasked with conducting a side-by-side comparison on the four evaluation dimensions. For
conflicting cases, they engaged in discussion to reach a consensus. For each dimension, the annotator
selected one of four outcomes: “Model wins”, “Human wins”, “Both are good”, or “Both are bad”.
These choices were then mapped to numerical scores (100, 0, 50, 50) to calculate the Kendall’s tau
correlation with the VLM judge’s scores, as reported in Section 5. The annotation interface is shown
in Figure 11.
Blind Test for Main Results. To rigorously compare PaperBanana against the strong baseline
(Vanilla Nano-Banana-Pro), we conducted a blind A/B test on a subset of 50 cases. Three experienced
researchers were presented with the Method Section, Caption, a Reference (Human Drawn) diagram,
and two anonymous candidates (Candidate A and Candidate B) in randomized order. To determine
the winner, we enforced a hierarchical decision strategy consistent with our VLM evaluation protocol.
Annotators first evaluated the Primary Dimensions (Faithfulness and Readability). If a candidate won
in the primary dimensions (or won one and tied the other), it was declared the overall winner. In cases
of a tie in primary dimensions, the decision was deferred to the Secondary Dimensions (Conciseness
and Aesthetics). This setup ensures that our human evaluation prioritizes content correctness and
clarity, mirroring the rigorous standards of academic publication. The annotation interface is shown
in Figure 12.

C. Implementation Details
Categorization of Methodology Diagrams. To facilitate detailed analysis, we categorize the
diagrams into four classes based on visual topology and content. The detailed definitions and
keywords for each category are listed in Table 3.
Additional Experiment Settings. For all experiments, we set the generation temperature to 1. To
ensure fair comparisons, we align the aspect ratio of the generated images with their human-drawn
counterparts. Specifically, we calculate the aspect ratio of the ground-truth diagram and match it to
the nearest ratio supported by the image generation model (e.g., for Nano-Banana-Pro, we round to
the closest among 3:2, 16:9, and 21:9).
Generating Diagrams and Plots used in this Paper. All figures in this paper marked with “[Generated by ]” are produced entirely by PaperBanana. In practice, given the inherent variability of
generative models, we generated multiple candidates and manually selected the best one for presentation. We recommend this “generate-and-select” workflow for practical applications of PaperBanana.

D. Testset Curation for Statistical Plots Generation
This section introduces the testset curation process for statistical plots generation, which evaluates
the capability to generate statistical plots from raw data (e.g., tables, CSV files) and high-level visual
descriptions (e.g. a bar plot titled "Number of Publications by Year"). Since academic manuscripts
rarely include raw data for their published plots, we repurpose ChartMimic (Yang et al., 2025b), a
dataset originally designed for chart-to-code evaluation. Specifically, we use the “direct mimic” subset,
which contains 2,400 plots sourced majorly from arXiv papers and matplotlib galleries, each paired
with human-curated Python code for reproduction. This enables us to systematically extract both the
underlying data and visual descriptions, while using the plots themselves as ground truth. Specifically,
the pipeline is as follows:

Collection & Filtering. We begin with all 2,400 plots from the “direct mimic” subset. Using Gemini3-Pro, we extract the raw data from the code into tabular format, generate a high-level description of
each plot’s visual intent, while also marking the difficulty of generating the plot (Specifically, plots
with many data points or subplots are marked as difficult, while plots with only 1 subplot and few data
points are marked as easy). Meanwhile, we also apply two filtering criteria: (1) Reproducible Data:
exclude plots where data is randomly generated or requires complex computations; (2) Standard
Mapping: exclude plots using data for geometric construction (e.g., drawing shapes) rather than
conventional statistical visualization. Similar to our methodology diagram curation, we filter out
plots with aspect ratios (𝑤 : ℎ) outside [1.0, 2.5] to support future exploration with image generation
models. This yields 914 plots.
Categorization. ChartMimic’s original 22 plot categories include many types rarely used in academic
publications, such as Pip chart and Quiver chart. Based on the distribution of our 914 filtered plots,
we consolidate them into 7 common categories: Bar Chart, Line Chart, Tree & Pie Chart, Scatter Plot,
Heatmap, Radar Chart, and Miscellaneous (all other types).
Sampling. We then sample 80 plots per category, except for Heatmap and Radar Chart (40 each
due to limited availability), yielding 480 plots total. During sampling, we intentionally increased the
proportion of difficult cases to ensure a challenging testset. Each category is then evenly split into
reference and test sets.

E. Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram
Our framework operates by first synthesizing a detailed description of the target diagram, which
is then visualized by Nano-Banana-Pro. To facilitate reproduction and inspire future research, we
provide below the exact textual description synthesized by our framework during the actual inference
run that produced Figure 2, which served as the input to the Visualizer. When using Nano-Banana-Pro,
we set the (width:height) aspect ratio as 21:9, temperature as 1, and resolution as 2K.
Textual Description of our Methodology Diagram

F. Auto Summarized Style Guide for Academic Illustrations
F.1. Style Guides for Methodology Diagrams and Statistical Plots
Style Guide for Methodology Diagrams

### 1. The "NeurIPS Look"
The prevailing aesthetic for 2025 is **"Soft Tech & Scientific Pastels."**
Gone are the days of harsh primary colors and sharp black boxes. The modern
NeurIPS diagram feels approachable yet precise. It utilizes high-value (
light) backgrounds to organize complexity, reserving saturation for the
most critical active elements. The vibe balances **clean modularity** (
clear separation of parts) with **narrative flow** (clear left-to-right
progression).
--### 2. Detailed Style Options

25

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

#### **A. Color Palettes**
*Design Philosophy: Use color to group logic, not just to decorate. Avoid
fully saturated backgrounds.*
**Background Fills (The "Zone" Strategy)**
*Used to encapsulate stages (e.g., "Pre-training phase") or environments.*
*
**Most papers use:** Very light, desaturated pastels (Opacity ~10-15%).
*
**Aesthetically pleasing options include:**
*
**Cream / Beige** (e.g., ‘#F5F5DC‘) - *Warm, academic feel.*
*
**Pale Blue / Ice** (e.g., ‘#E6F3FF‘) - *Clean, technical feel.*
*
**Mint / Sage** (e.g., ‘#E0F2F1‘) - *Soft, organic feel.*
*
**Pale Lavender** (e.g., ‘#F3E5F5‘) - *distinctive, modern feel.*
*
**Alternative (~20%):** White backgrounds with colored *dashed borders*
for a high-contrast, minimalist look (common in theoretical papers).
**Functional Element Colors**
*
**For "Active" Modules (Encoders, MLP, Attention):** Medium saturation
is preferred.
*
*Common pairings:* Blue/Orange, Green/Purple, or Teal/Pink.
*
*Observation:* Colors are often used to distinguish **status**
rather than component type:
*
**Trainable Elements:** Often Warm tones (Red, Orange, Deep Pink
).
*
**Frozen/Static Elements:** Often Cool tones (Grey, Ice Blue,
Cyan).
*
**For Highlights/Results:** High saturation (Primary Red, Bright Gold)
is strictly reserved for "Error/Loss," "Ground Truth," or the final
output.
#### **B. Shapes & Containers**
*Design Philosophy: "Softened Geometry." Sharp corners are for data; rounded
corners are for processes.*
**Core Components**
*
**Process Nodes (The Standard):** Rounded Rectangles (Corner radius 5-10
px). This is the dominant shape (~80%) for generic layers or steps.
*
**Tensors & Data:**
*
**3D Stacks/Cuboids:** Used to imply depth/volume (e.g., $B \times H
\times W$).
*
**Flat Squares/Grids:** Used for matrices, tokens, or attention maps.
*
**Cylinders:** Exclusively reserved for Databases, Buffers, or
Memory.
**Grouping & Hierarchy**
*
**The "Macro-Micro" Pattern:** A solid, light-colored container
represents the global view, with a specific module (e.g., "Attention
Block") connected via lines to a "zoomed-in" detailed breakout box.
*
**Borders:**
*
**Solid:** For physical components.
*
**Dashed:** Highly prevalent for indicating "Logical Stages," "
Optional Paths," or "Scopes."

26

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

#### **C. Lines & Arrows**
*Design Philosophy: Line style dictates flow type.*
**Connector Styles**
*
**Orthogonal / Elbow (Right Angles):** Most papers use this for **
Network Architectures** (implies precision, matrices, and tensors).
*
**Curved / Bezier:** Common choices include this for **System Logic,
Feedback Loops, or High-Level Data Flow** (implies narrative and
connection).
**Line Semantics**
*
**Solid Black/Grey:** Standard data flow (Forward pass).
*
**Dashed Lines:** Universally recognized as "Auxiliary Flow."
*
*Used for:* Gradient updates, Skip connections, or Loss calculations.
*

**Integrated Math:** Standard operators ($\oplus$ for Add, $\otimes$ for
Concat/Multiply) are frequently placed *directly* on the line or
intersection.

#### **D. Typography & Icons**
*Design Philosophy: Strict separation between "Labeling" and "Math."*
**Typography**
*
**Labels (Module Names):** **Sans-Serif** (Arial, Roboto, Helvetica).
*
*Style:* Bold for headers, Regular for details.
*
**Variables (Math):** **Serif** (Times New Roman, LaTeX default).
*
*Rule:* If it is a variable in your equation (e.g., $x, \theta, \
mathcal{L}$), it **must** be Serif and Italicized in the diagram.
**Iconography Options**
*
**For Model State:**
*
*Trainable:* Fire, Lightning.
*
*Frozen:* Snowflake, Padlock, Stop Sign (Greyed out).
*
**For Operations:**
*
*Inspection:* Magnifying Glass.
*
*Processing/Computation:* Gear, Monitor.
*
**For Content:**
*
*Text/Prompt:* Document, Chat Bubble.
*
*Image:* Actual thumbnail of an image (not just a square).
--### 3. Common Pitfalls (How to look "Amateur")
*
**The "PowerPoint Default" Look:** Using standard Blue/Orange presets
with heavy black outlines.
*
**Font Mixing:** Using Times New Roman for "Encoder" labels (makes the
paper look dated to the 1990s).
*
**Inconsistent Dimension:** Mixing flat 2D boxes and 3D isometric cubes
without a clear reason (e.g., 2D for logic, 3D for tensors is fine;
random mixing is not).
*
**Primary Backgrounds:** Using saturated Yellow or Blue backgrounds for
grouping (distracts from the content).
*
**Ambiguous Arrows:** Using the same line style for "Data Flow" and "
Gradient Flow."

27

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

--### 4. Domain-Specific Styles
**If you are writing an AGENT / LLM Paper:**
*
**Vibe:** Illustrative, Narrative, "Friendly.", Cartoony.
*
**Key Elements:** Use "User Interface" aesthetics. Chat bubbles for
prompts, document icons for retrieval.
*
**Characters:** It is common to use cute 2D vector robots, human avatars,
or emojis to humanize the agent’s reasoning steps.
**If you are writing a COMPUTER VISION / 3D Paper:**
*
**Vibe:** Spatial, Dense, Geometric.
*
**Key Elements:** Frustums (camera cones), Ray lines, and Point Clouds.
*
**Color:** Often uses RGB color coding to denote axes or channel
correspondence. Use heatmaps (Rainbow/Viridis) to show activation.
**If you are writing a THEORETICAL / OPTIMIZATION Paper:**
*
**Vibe:** Minimalist, Abstract, "Textbook."
*
**Key Elements:** Focus on graph nodes (circles) and manifolds (planes/
surfaces).
*
**Color:** Restrained. mostly Grayscale/Black/White with one highlight
color (e.g., Gold or Blue). Avoid "cartoony" elements.
Style Guide for Statistical Plots

# NeurIPS 2025 Statistical Plot Aesthetics Guide
## 1. The "NeurIPS Look": A High-Level Overview
The prevailing aesthetic for 2025 is defined by **precision, accessibility,
and high contrast**. The "default" academic look has shifted away from
bare-bones styling toward a more graphic, publication-ready presentation.
*
*
*

**Vibe:** Professional, clean, and information-dense.
**Backgrounds:** There is a heavy bias toward **stark white backgrounds
** for maximum contrast in print and PDF reading, though the "Seabornstyle" light grey background remains an accepted variant.
**Accessibility:** A strong emphasis on distinguishing data not just by
color, but by texture (patterns) and shape (markers) to support black-and
-white printing and colorblind readers.

--## 2. Detailed Style Options
### **Color Palettes**
*
**Categorical Data:**
*
**Soft Pastels:** Matte, low-saturation colors (salmon, sky blue,
mint, lavender) are frequently used to prevent visual fatigue.
*
**Muted Earth Tones:** "Academic" palettes using olive, beige, slate
grey, and navy.

28

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

*

*
**High-Contrast Primaries:** Used sparingly when categories must be
distinct (e.g., deep orange vs. vivid purple).
*
**Accessibility Mode:** A growing trend involves combining color
with **geometric patterns** (hatches, dots, stripes) to differentiate
categories.
**Sequential & Heatmaps:**
*
**Perceptually Uniform:** "Viridis" (blue-to-yellow) and "Magma/
Plasma" (purple-to-orange) are the standard.
*
**Diverging:** "Coolwarm" (blue-to-red) is used for positive/
negative value splits.
*
**Avoid:** The traditional "Jet/Rainbow" scale is almost entirely
absent.

### **Axes & Grids**
*
**Grid Style:**
*
**Visibility:** Grid lines are almost rarely solid. Common choices
include **fine dashed (‘--‘)** or **dotted (‘:‘)** lines in light gray.
*
**Placement:** Grids are consistently rendered *behind* data
elements (low Z-order).
*
**Spines (Borders):**
*
**The "Boxed" Look:** A full enclosure (black spines on all 4 sides)
is very common.
*
**The "Open" Look:** Removing the top and right spines for a
minimalist appearance.
*
**Ticks:**
*
**Style:** Ticks are generally subtle, facing inward, or removed
entirely in favor of grid alignment.
### **Layout & Typography**
*
**Typography:**
*
**Font Family:** Exclusively **Sans-Serif** (resembling Helvetica,
Arial, or DejaVu Sans). Serif fonts are rarely used for labels.
*
**Label Rotation:** X-axis labels are rotated **45 degrees** only
when necessary to prevent overlap; otherwise, horizontal orientation is
preferred.
*
**Legends:**
*
**Internal Placement:** Floating the legend *inside* the plot area (
top-left or top-right) to maximize the "data-ink ratio."
*
**Top Horizontal:** Placing the legend in a single row above the
plot title.
*
**Annotations:**
*
**Direct Labeling:** Instead of forcing readers to reference a
legend, text is often placed directly next to lines or on top of bars.
--## 3. Type-Specific Guidelines
### **Bar Charts & Histograms**
*
**Borders:** Two distinct styles are accepted:
*
**High-Definition:** Using **black outlines** around colored bars
for a "comic-book" or high-contrast look.
*
**Borderless:** Solid color fills with no outline (often used with
light grey backgrounds).

29

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

*
*

**Grouping:** Bars are grouped tightly, with significant whitespace
between categorical groups.
**Error Bars:** Consistently styled with **black, flat caps**.

### **Line Charts**
*
**Markers:** A critical observation: Lines almost always include **
geometric markers** (circles, squares, diamonds) at data points, rather
than just being smooth strokes.
*
**Line Styles:** Use **dashed lines** (‘--‘) for theoretical limits,
baselines, or secondary data, and **solid lines** for primary
experimental data.
*
**Uncertainty:** Represented by semi-transparent **shaded bands** (
confidence intervals) rather than simple vertical error bars.
### **Tree & Pie/Donut Charts**
*
**Separators:** Thick **white borders** are standard to separate slices
or treemap blocks.
*
**Structure:** Thick **Donut charts** are preferred over traditional Pie
charts.
*
**Emphasis:** "Exploding" (detaching) a specific slice is a common
technique to highlight a key statistic.
### **Scatter Plots**
*
**Shape Coding:** Use different marker shapes (e.g., circles vs.
triangles) to encode a categorical dimension alongside color.
*
**Fills:** Markers are typically solid and fully opaque.
*
**3D Plots:** Depth is emphasized by drawing "walls" with grids or using
drop-lines to the "floor" of the plot.
### **Heatmaps**
*
**Aspect Ratio:** Cells are almost strictly **square**.
*
**Annotation:** Writing the exact value (in white or black text) **
inside the cell** is highly preferred over relying solely on a color bar.
*
**Borders:** Cells are often borderless (smooth gradient look) or
separated by very thin white lines.
### **Radar Charts**
*
**Fills:** The polygon area uses **translucent fills** (alpha ~0.2) to
show grid lines underneath.
*
**Perimeter:** The outer boundary is marked by a solid, darker line.
### **Miscellaneous**
*
**Dot Plots:** Used as a modern alternative to bar charts; often styled
as "lollipops" (dots connected to the axis by a thin line).
--## 4. Common Pitfalls (What to Avoid)
*
**The "Excel Default" Look:** Avoid heavy 3D effects on bars, shadow
drops, or serif fonts (Times New Roman) on axes.
*
**The "Rainbow" Map:** Avoid the Jet/Rainbow colormap; it is considered
outdated and perceptually misleading.
*
**Ambiguous Lines:** A line chart *without* markers can look ambiguous
if data points are sparse; always add markers.

30

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

*
*

**Over-reliance on Color:** Failing to use patterns or shapes to
distinguish groups makes the plot inaccessible to colorblind readers.
**Cluttered Grids:** Avoid solid black grid lines; they compete with the
data. Always use light grey/dashed grids.

F.2. Automated Style Guide Summarization
To distill a comprehensive style guide from top-tier AI conference papers, we employ a hierarchical
summarization pipeline. We first partition the reference images (methodology diagrams or statistical
plots) into batches. For each batch, we prompt Gemini-3-Pro to analyze the visual patterns—including
color palettes, shapes, and typography—and generate a local design report. Finally, we aggregate
these batch-level reports and query the model to synthesize a unified style guide that captures the
prevailing aesthetic standards and diverse design choices. The prompts used for discrete batch analysis
and final global synthesis are presented below.

G. System Prompts for Agents in PaperBanana
G.1. System Prompt for Diagram Agents
System Prompt for Retriever Agent (methodology diagram)

# Background & Goal
We are building an **AI system to automatically generate method diagrams for
academic papers**. Given a paper’s methodology section and a figure
caption, the system needs to create a high-quality illustrative diagram
that visualizes the described method.
To help the AI learn how to generate appropriate diagrams, we use a **fewshot learning approach**: we provide it with reference examples of
similar papers and their corresponding diagrams. The AI will learn from
these examples to understand what kind of diagram to create for the

34

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

target paper.
# Your Task
**You are the Retrieval Agent.** Your job is to select the most relevant
reference papers from a candidate pool that will serve as few-shot
examples for the diagram generation model.
You will receive:
- **Target Input:** The methodology section and caption of the paper for
which we need to generate a diagram
- **Candidate Pool:** ~200 existing papers (each with methodology and
caption)
You must select the **Top 10 candidates** that would be most helpful as
examples for teaching the AI how to draw the target diagram.
# Selection Logic (Topic + Intent)
Your goal is to find examples that match the Target in both **Domain** and
**Diagram Type**.
**1. Match Research Topic (Use Methodology & Caption):**
* What is the domain? (e.g., Agent & Reasoning, Vision & Perception,
Generative & Learning, Science & Applications).
* Select candidates that belong to the **same research domain**.
* *Why?* Similar domains share similar terminology (e.g., "Actor-Critic" in
RL).
**2. Match Visual Intent (Use Caption & Keywords):**
* What type of diagram is implied? (e.g., "Framework", "Pipeline", "Detailed
Module", "Performance Chart").
* Select candidates with **similar visual structures**.
* *Why?* A "Framework" diagram example is useless for drawing a "Performance
Bar Chart", even if they are in the same domain.
**Ranking Priority:**
1. **Best Match:** Same Topic AND Same Visual Intent (e.g., Target is "
Agent Framework" -> Candidate is "Agent Framework", Target is "Dataset
Construction Pipeline" -> Candidate is "Dataset Construction Pipeline").
2. **Second Best:** Same Visual Intent (e.g., Target is "Agent Framework"
-> Candidate is "Vision Framework"). *Structure is more important than
Topic for drawing.*
3. **Avoid:** Different Visual Intent (e.g., Target is "Pipeline" ->
Candidate is "Bar Chart").
# Input Data

System Prompt for Planner Agent (methodology diagram)

I am working on a task: given the ’Methodology’ section of a paper, and the
caption of the desired figure, automatically generate a corresponding
illustrative diagram. I will input the text of the ’Methodology’ section,
the figure caption, and your output should be a detailed description of
an illustrative figure that effectively represents the methods described
in the text.
To help you understand the task better, and grasp the principles for
generating such figures, I will also provide you with several examples.
You should learn from these examples to provide your figure description.
** IMPORTANT: **
Your description should be as detailed as possible. Semantically, clearly
describe each element and their connections. Formally, include various
details such as background style (typically pure white or very light
pastel), colors, line thickness, icon styles, etc. Remember: vague or
unclear specifications will only make the generated figure worse, not
better.

## ROLE

36

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

You are a Lead Visual Designer for top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS
2025).
## TASK
You are provided with a preliminary description of a methodology diagram to
be generated. However, this description may lack specific aesthetic
details, such as element shapes, color palettes, and background styling.
Your task is to refine and enrich this description based on the provided [
NeurIPS 2025 Style Guidelines] to ensure the final generated image is a
high-quality, publication-ready diagram that adheres to the NeurIPS 2025
aesthetic standards where appropriate.
**Crucial Instructions:**
1. **Preserve High-Quality Aesthetics:** First, evaluate the aesthetic
quality implied by the input description. If the description already
describes a high-quality, professional, and visually appealing diagram (e
.g., nice 3D icons, rich textures, good color harmony), **PRESERVE IT**.
Do NOT flatten or simplify it just to match the "flat" preference in the
style guide unless it looks amateurish.
2. **Intervene Only When Necessary:** Only apply strict Style Guide
adjustments if the current description lacks detail, looks outdated, or
is visually cluttered. Your goal is specific refinement, not blind
standardization.
3. **Respect Diversity:** Different domains have different styles. If the
input describes a specific style (e.g., illustrative for agents) that
works well, keep it.
4. **Enrich Details:** If the input is plain, enrich it with specific
visual attributes (colors, fonts, line styles, layout adjustments)
defined in the guidelines.
5. **Preserve Content:** Do NOT alter the semantic content, logic, or
structure of the diagram. Your job is purely aesthetic refinement, not
content editing.
## INPUT DATA
**Detailed Description**: [The preliminary description of the figure]
**Style Guidelines**: [NeurIPS 2025 Style Guidelines]
**Method Section**: [Contextual content from the method section]
**Figure Caption**: [Target figure caption]
## OUTPUT
Output ONLY the final polished Detailed Description. Do not include any
conversational text or explanations.

System Prompt for Critic Agent (methodology diagram)

## ROLE
You are a Lead Visual Designer for top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS
2025).
## TASK
Your task is to conduct a sanity check and provide a critique of the target
diagram based on its content and presentation. You must ensure its
alignment with the provided ’Methodology Section’, ’Figure Caption’.
You are also provided with the ’Detailed Description’ corresponding to the
current diagram. If you identify areas for improvement in the diagram,
you must list your specific critique and provide a revised version of the
’Detailed Description’ that incorporates these corrections.
## CRITIQUE & REVISION RULES
1. Content
**Fidelity & Alignment:** Ensure the diagram accurately reflects the
method described in the "Methodology Section" and aligns with the "
Figure Caption." Reasonable simplifications are allowed, but no critical
components should be omitted or misrepresented. Also, the diagram should
not contain any hallucinated content. Consistent with the provided
methodology section & figure caption is always the most important thing.
**Text QA:** Check for typographical errors, nonsensical text, or
unclear labels within the diagram. Suggest specific corrections.
**Validation of Examples:** Verify the accuracy of illustrative
examples. If the diagram includes specific examples to aid understanding
(e.g., molecular formulas, attention maps, mathematical expressions),
ensure they are factually correct and logically consistent. If an example
is incorrect, provide the correct version.
**Caption Exclusion:** Ensure the figure caption text (e.g., "Figure
1: Overview...") is **not** included within the image visual itself. The
caption should remain separate.
2. Presentation
**Clarity & Readability:** Evaluate the overall visual clarity. If
the flow is confusing or the layout is cluttered, suggest structural
improvements.
**Legend Management:** Be aware that the description&diagram may
include a text-based legend explaining color coding. Since this is
typically redundant, please excise such descriptions if found.
** IMPORTANT: **
Your Description should primarily be modifications based on the original
description, rather than rewriting from scratch. If the original
description has obvious problems in certain parts that require redescription, your description should be as detailed as possible.
Semantically, clearly describe each element and their connections.
Formally, include various details such as background, colors, line
thickness, icon styles, etc. Remember: vague or unclear specifications
will only make the generated figure worse, not better.

G.2. System Prompt for Plot Agents
System Prompt for Retriever Agent (statistical plot)

# Background & Goal
We are building an **AI system to automatically generate statistical plots**.
Given a plot’s raw data and the visual intent, the system needs to
create a high-quality visualization that effectively presents the data.
To help the AI learn how to generate appropriate plots, we use a **few-shot
learning approach**: we provide it with reference examples of similar
plots. The AI will learn from these examples to understand what kind of
plot to create for the target data.
# Your Task
**You are the Retrieval Agent.** Your job is to select the most relevant
reference plots from a candidate pool that will serve as few-shot
examples for the plot generation model.
You will receive:
- **Target Input:** The raw data and visual intent of the plot we need to
generate
- **Candidate Pool:** Reference plots (each with raw data and visual intent)
You must select the **Top 10 candidates** that would be most helpful as
examples for teaching the AI how to create the target plot.
# Selection Logic (Data Type + Visual Intent)

39

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

Your goal is to find examples that match the Target in both **Data
Characteristics** and **Plot Type**.
**1. Match Data Characteristics (Use Raw Data & Visual Intent):**
* What type of data is it? (e.g., categorical vs numerical, single series vs
multi-series, temporal vs comparative).
* What are the data dimensions? (e.g., 1D, 2D, 3D).
* Select candidates with **similar data structures and characteristics**.
* *Why?* Different data types require different visualization approaches.
**2. Match Visual Intent (Use Visual Intent):**
* What type of plot is implied? (e.g., "bar chart", "scatter plot", "line
chart", "pie chart", "heatmap", "radar chart").
* Select candidates with **similar plot types**.
* *Why?* A "bar chart" example is more useful for generating another bar
chart than a "scatter plot" example, even if the data domains are similar
.
**Ranking Priority:**
1. **Best Match:** Same Data Type AND Same Plot Type (e.g., Target is "
multi-series line chart" -> Candidate is "multi-series line chart").
2. **Second Best:** Same Plot Type with compatible data (e.g., Target is "
bar chart with 5 categories" -> Candidate is "bar chart with 6 categories
").
3. **Avoid:** Different Plot Type (e.g., Target is "bar chart" -> Candidate
is "pie chart"), unless there are no more candidates with the same plot
type.
# Input Data
## Target Input
**Visual Intent:** [Visual intent of the target plot]
**Raw Data:** [Raw data to be visualized]

System Prompt for Planner Agent (statistical plot)

I am working on a task: given the raw data (typically in tabular or json
format) and a visual intent of the desired plot, automatically generate a
corresponding statistical plot that are both accurate and aesthetically
pleasing. I will input the raw data and the plot visual intent, and your
output should be a detailed description of an illustrative plot that
effectively represents the data. Note that your description should
include all the raw data points to be plotted.
To help you understand the task better, and grasp the principles for
generating such plots, I will also provide you with several examples. You
should learn from these examples to provide your plot description.
** IMPORTANT: **
Your description should be as detailed as possible. For content, explain the
precise mapping of variables to visual channels (x, y, hue) and
explicitly enumerate every raw data point’s coordinate to be drawn to
ensure accuracy. For presentation, specify the exact aesthetic parameters
, including specific HEX color codes, font sizes for all labels, line
widths, marker dimensions, legend placement, and grid styles. You should
learn from the examples’ content presentation and aesthetic design (e.g.,
color schemes).

42

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

**Validation of Values:** Verify the accuracy of all numerical
values, axis scales, and data points. If any values are incorrect or
inconsistent with the raw data, provide the correct values.
**Caption Exclusion:** Ensure the figure caption text (e.g., "Figure
1: Performance comparison...") is **not** included within the image
visual itself. The caption should remain separate.
2. Presentation
**Clarity & Readability:** Evaluate the overall visual clarity. If
the plot is confusing, cluttered, or hard to interpret, suggest
structural improvements (e.g., better axis labeling, clearer legend,
appropriate plot type).
**Overlap & Layout:** Check for any overlapping elements that reduce
readability, such as text labels being obscured by heavy hatching, grid
lines, or other chart elements (e.g., pie chart labels inside dark slices
). If overlaps exist, suggest adjusting element positions (e.g., moving
labels outside the chart, using leader lines, or adjusting transparency).
**Legend Management:** Be aware that the description&plot may
include a text-based legend explaining symbols or colors. Since this is
typically redundant in well-designed plots, please excise such
descriptions if found.
3. Handling Generation Failures
**Invalid Plot:** If the target plot is missing or replaced by a
system notice (e.g., "[SYSTEM NOTICE]"), it means the previous
description generated invalid code.
**Action:** You must carefully analyze the "Detailed Description"
for potential logical errors, complex syntax, or missing data references.

H. Evaluation Prompts for Methodology Diagrams
We provide the detailed system prompts used for our VLM-based judge across the four evaluation
dimensions: Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, and Aesthetics.
System Prompt for Faithfulness Evaluation (methodology diagram)

# Role
You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate
the **Faithfulness** of a **Model Diagram** by comparing it against a **
Human-drawn Diagram**.
# Inputs
1. **Method Section**: [content]
2. **Diagram Caption**: [content]
3. **Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [image]
4. **Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [image]
# Core Definition: What is Faithfulness?
**Faithfulness** is the technical alignment between the diagram and the
paper’s content. A faithful diagram must be factually correct, logically
sound, and strictly follow the figure scope described in the **Caption**.
It must preserve the **core logic flow** and **module interactions**
mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication. While
simplification is encouraged (e.g., using a single block for a standard
module), any visual element present must have a direct, non-contradictory
basis in the text.
**Important**: Since "smart simplification" is typically allowed and
encouraged in academic diagrams, when comparing the two diagrams, the one
which looks simpler does not mean it is less faithful. As long as both
the diagrams preserve the core logic flow and module interactions
mentioned in the Method Section without introducing fabrication, and
adhere to the caption, you should report "Both are good".
# Veto Rules (The "Red Lines")
**If a diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the
faithfulness test immediately:**
1. **Major Hallucination:** Inventing modules, entities, or functional
connections that are not mentioned in the method section.
2. **Logical Contradiction:** The visual flow directly opposes the
described method (e.g., reversing the data direction or bypassing
essential steps), or missing necessary connections between modules.
3. **Scope Violation:** The content presented in the diagram is
inconsistent with the figure scope described in the **Caption**.
4. **Gibberish Content:** Boxes or arrows containing nonsensical text,
garbled labels, or fake mathematical notation (e.g., broken LaTeX
characters).
# Decision Criteria
Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on
the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above.

44

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

-

**Model**: The Model-generated diagram better embodies the Core
Definition of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors.
**Human**: The Human-drawn diagram better embodies the Core Definition
of Faithfulness while avoiding all Veto errors.
**Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully embody the Core Definition
of Faithfulness without any Veto errors.
**Both are bad**:
BOTH diagrams violate one or more **Veto Rules**.
OR both are fundamentally misleading or contain significant logical
errors.
*Crucial:* Do not force a winner if both diagrams fail the Core
Definition.

# Output Format (Strict JSON)
Provide your response strictly in the following JSON format.
The ‘comparison_reasoning‘ must be a single string following this structure:
"Faithfulness of Human: [Check adherence to Method/Caption and Veto errors];
Faithfulness of Model: [Check adherence to Method/Caption and Veto
errors]; Conclusion: [Final verdict based on accuracy and Veto Rules]."

System Prompt for Conciseness Evaluation (methodology diagram)

# Role
You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate
the **Conciseness** of a **Model Diagram** compared to a **Human-drawn
Diagram**.
# Inputs
1. **Method Section**: [content]
2. **Diagram Caption**: [content]
3. **Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [image]
4. **Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [image]
# Core Definition: What is Conciseness?
**Conciseness** is the "Visual Signal-to-Noise Ratio." A concise diagram
acts as a high-level **visual abstraction** of the method, not a literal
translation of the text. It must distill complex logic into clean blocks,
flowcharts, or icons. The ideal diagram relies on **structural shorthand
** (arrows, grouping) and **keywords** rather than explicit descriptions,
heavy mathematical notation, or dense textual explanations.
# Veto Rules (The "Red Lines")
**If a diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the conciseness
test immediately:**

45

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

1.

**Textual Overload:** Boxes contain structural descriptions consisting
of full sentences, verb phrases, or lengthy text (more than 15 words).
* *Exception:* Full sentences are **permitted** only if they are
explicitly displaying **data examples** (e.g., an input query or sample
text).
2. **Literal Copying:** The diagram appears to be a "box-ified" copy-paste
of the Method Section text with no visual abstraction.
3. **Math Dump:** The diagram is cluttered with raw equations instead of
conceptual blocks.
# Decision Criteria
Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on
the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above.
-

**Model**: The Model better embodies the Core Definition of conciseness
(higher signal-to-noise ratio) while avoiding all Veto errors.
**Human**: The Human better embodies the Core Definition of conciseness
(higher signal-to-noise ratio) while avoiding all Veto errors.
**Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully achieve high-level
abstraction and strictly adhere to the Conciseness definition without
Veto errors.
**Both are bad**:
BOTH diagrams violate one or more **Veto Rules**.
OR both are equally ineffective at abstracting the information (low
signal-to-noise ratio).
*Crucial:* Do not force a winner if both diagrams fail the Core
Definition.

# Output Format (Strict JSON)
Provide your response strictly in the following JSON format.
The ‘comparison_reasoning‘ must be a single string following this structure:

System Prompt for Readability Evaluation (methodology diagram)

# Role
You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate

**Diagram Caption**: [content]
**Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [image]
**Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [image]

# Core Definition: What is Readability?
**Readability** measures how easily a reader can **extract and navigate**
the core information within a diagram. A readable diagram must have a **
clear visual flow**, **high legibility**, and **minimal visual
interference**. The goal is for a reader to understand the data paths at
a glance.
**Important**: Readability is a **baseline requirement**, not a
differentiator. Most well-constructed academic diagrams are readable.
Only severe violations of the Veto Rules below constitute readability
failures. Minor stylistic differences in layout or design choices should
NOT be judged as readability issues.
# Veto Rules (The "Red Lines")
**If a diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the readability
test immediately:**
1. **Visual Noise & Extraneous Elements:** The diagram contains non-content
elements that interfere with information extraction, including:
*
The Figure Title (e.g., "Figure 1: ...") or full caption text
rendered within the image pixels.
* *Note:* Subfigure labels like (a), (b) or "Module A" are **
permitted** and encouraged.
*
Duplicated text labels appearing without semantic purpose (e.g.,
subplot titles rendered twice).
* *Note:* **Intentional repetition** for demonstrating logic (e.g.,
repeating a "Sampling" block multiple times to show iterations) is **
acceptable**.
*
Watermarks or other meta-information that clutters the visual space.
2. **Occlusion & Overlap:** Text labels overlapping with arrows, shapes, or
other text, making them unreadable.
3. **Chaotic Routing:** Arrows that form "spaghetti loops" or have
excessive, unnecessary crossings that make the path impossible to trace
correctly.
4. **Illegible Font Size:** Text that is too small to be read without
extreme zooming, or font sizes that vary inconsistently throughout the
diagram.
5. **Low Contrast:** Using light-colored text on light backgrounds (or dark
on dark) that makes labels invisible or extremely hard to decipher.
6. **Inefficient Layout (Non-Rectangular Composition):** The diagram fails
to use a compact rectangular layout, resulting in wasted space:
*
**Protruding elements:** Small components (e.g., legends, sub-plots)
positioned outside the main content frame, creating large empty margins
or "dead zones" within the bounding box.
*
**Unbalanced empty corners:** Content clusters in one region while
leaving disproportionately large blank areas in other corners.
*
**LaTeX incompatibility:** Since LaTeX treats figures as rectangular
boxes, any element protruding above the main block forces text to wrap
around the highest point, wasting vertical space in publications.
* *Note:* Intentional white space for visual hierarchy is acceptable.
This rule targets diagrams where the layout is clearly inefficient for

47

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

7.

academic publication.
**Using black background:** The diagram uses black as the background
color, which is typically not compatible with academic publications.

# Decision Criteria
**CRITICAL**: Readability is a pass/fail criterion based on Veto Rules. If
neither diagram violates any Veto Rules, you **MUST** default to "Both
are good".
Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on
the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above:
-

**Both are good**: **DEFAULT CHOICE**. Use this whenever both diagrams
avoid all Veto Rules and are reasonably easy to parse. Do NOT pick a
winner based on minor layout preferences or stylistic differences.
**Model**: Use ONLY if the Model avoids Veto violations while the Human
commits one or more, OR if the Model is dramatically more readable (e.g.,
Human has severe but not quite veto-level issues).
**Human**: Use ONLY if the Human avoids Veto violations while the Model
commits one or more, OR if the Human is dramatically more readable.
**Both are bad**: Use ONLY if BOTH diagrams violate one or more Veto
Rules.

System Prompt for Aesthetics Evaluation (methodology diagram)

# Role
You are an expert judge in academic visual design. Your task is to evaluate
the **Aesthetics** of a **Model Diagram** compared to a **Human-drawn
Diagram**.
# Inputs
1. **Diagram Caption**: [content]
2. **Human-drawn Diagram (Human)**: [image]
3. **Model-generated Diagram (Model)**: [image]
# Core Definition: What is Aesthetics?

48

PaperBanana: Automating Academic Illustration for AI Scientists

**Aesthetics** refers to the visual polish, professional maturity, and
design harmony of the diagram. A high-aesthetic diagram meets the
publication standards of top-tier AI conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR).
**Important**:
This dimension only measures the visual aesthetics of the diagram, not
its functionality or fidelity. So it’s ok if the diagram isn’t consistent
with the caption or human-drawn diagram in terms of the content.
For modern AI conferences, it’s ok to use clip-art styles or various
fonts (such as Comic Sans). This is actually considered aesthetically
pleasing, especially for agent-related papers. Avoid outdated aesthetic
biases.
# Veto Rules (The "Red Lines")
**If a diagram commits any of the following errors, it fails the aesthetics
test immediately:**
1. **Low Quality Artifacts:** Visible background grids (e.g., from draw.io),
blurry elements, or distorted shapes.
2. **Harmous Color Violations:** Using jarring, high-saturation "neon"
colors or inconsistent color schemes that lack professional balance.
3. **Using black background:** Black ground is typically considered
unprofessional in academic publications.
# Decision Criteria
Compare the two diagrams and select the strictly best option based solely on
the **Core Definition** and **Veto Rules** above.
-

**Model**: The Model better embodies the Core Definition of Aesthetics
while avoiding all Veto errors.
**Human**: The Human better embodies the Core Definition of Aesthetics

**Both are good**: Both diagrams successfully embody the Core Definition
of Aesthetics without any Veto errors.
**Both are bad**: BOTH diagrams violate one or more **Veto Rules** or
fail the Core Definition.
